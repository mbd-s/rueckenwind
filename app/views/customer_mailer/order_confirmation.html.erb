  <p>Dear <%= @order.customer.first_name %>,</p>
  <p>We've received your order for <%= @order.total_bikes %> bikes.</p>
  <p>Here's what happens next:</p>
  <p>We'll email you as soon as we have an open space in a workshop. If you're free
    on that date, you'll confirm and come in at the appointed time to build your bike.
    If you're busy, it's no problem. Just let us know and we'll invite you to the next
    available workshop.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, <a href="http://rueckenwind.berlin/en/contact/" target="_blank">
    contact us</a> if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,<br>
    Rückenwind</p>
