  We are a nonprofit association whose mission is to make refugees in Berlin mobile and offer them a chance to be active.
  This is why we pursue a workshop in Neuk√∂lln where refugees repair donated bikes together with our team.
  We support a society in which every person has an equal standing and encourage the solidarity between its various members.
  The workshop is a place where people from different cultures come together and make positive experiences by fixing their own bikes.

  We currently hold workshops on Monday and Wednesday afternoons, and occasionally on Saturdays or Sundays. You can sign up to receive a bike, donate a bike, or volunteer in one of our
  workshops. You can also support the project by <a href="#">becoming a member</a>
  or contributing <a href="http://rueckenwind.berlin/en/home/?slide=support-us" target="_blank">financially</a>.
